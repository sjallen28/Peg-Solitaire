    "For the graphical user interface(GUI), I decided to use the tkinter module because it was simple to create buttons that had built in functionality and link them to the pre-existing functions so that the buttons were able to affect the original board and also reconfigure the properties of any button to reflect the `board` numpy array. An advantage of splitting the program into functions was that it also made it easy to provide extra functionality to the GUI by presenting a reset and undo button that were initially created for just the base game."

    "## Option 5: Auto-Solver\n",
    "On first researching how to create an algorithm to solve the code it became clear that a brute-force method wouldn't be entirely possible as there are approximately 8.5x10$^9$ board combinations possible. One way to reduce this is by making the most of a symmetrical board. As a dead-ends will also have 7 other congruent boards that are dead-ends which can be eliminated before they are even encountered. These boards can be read in as binary, as shown in the figure below, for all possible symmetries at which point the smallest binary is taken as an identifier of a dead end. Future boards can then produce their own list of bianries and compare it against this list, to reduce combinations that are computed."

    "## Moving the pegs\n",
    "Whilst designing this function to place and remove pegs, it was kept in mind to write the code so that it remained flexible if any modifications were desired (which later became the case). The pegs calculated to be removed were made in such a way that if the peg were able to jump more than one space, the game would account accordingly. This was useful when creating cheats for the game as it provided an easy way to adjust the base rules for the user."
